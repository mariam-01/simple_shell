This is a simple Unix shell implementation called "hsh" (short for "Holberton Shell"). It is designed to provide basic shell functionalities similar to the /bin/sh shell.
Description
The "hsh" shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Unix operating system. It reads user commands, interprets them, and executes the corresponding actions or programs. The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes of operation.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Unix system calls, process management, file operations, and basic shell functionality. It is implemented in C programming language and follows the specifications provided in the project requirements.
